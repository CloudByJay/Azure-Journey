# ☁️ Cloud Computing Journey Timeline

A raw, honest log of my learning path in cloud computing and related tech. From zero to certified—one step at a time.

## 🚀 March 2025 – The Kickoff

### ✅ TryHackMe Pre-Security Certificate  
Started with cybersecurity fundamentals. Networking, Linux basics, security concepts. Beginner-friendly, but not fluff. Built a mental map of how systems talk—and how they break.

### ✅ Introduction to Computers (Microsoft via Coursera)  
Next, I locked down the basics. Hardware, software, operating systems, IT terminology. It wasn’t flashy, but skipping this would’ve been dumb. No weak foundations here.

### 🌩️ Started Learning Cloud Computing (AZ-900 Prep)  
Began studying for the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900). Learned about cloud models, Azure services, governance, pricing, and compliance. It was a lot—but it started clicking.

## ✅ April 2025 – First Milestone Locked In

### 🏆 Passed AZ-900 on the First Attempt  
Completed my AZ-900 prep and passed the exam. First official cloud cert: **Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals**. It’s the starting line—not the finish—but it proves I’ve got the fundamentals down. No guessing, no cramming, just real understanding.
