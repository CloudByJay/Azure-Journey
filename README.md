# 👋 Hey, I’m Jason — aka CloudByJay

I'm a cloud computing student on a focused path toward a junior cloud/infra role. No fluff—just consistent, public work toward real-world skills in Azure. This GitHub is where I document everything: study notes, scripts, projects, and progress.

---

### ☁️ Current Focus
- Earning Microsoft certifications (AZ-900 ✅, AZ-104 🔜)
- Hands-on labs with Azure services (VMs, Web Apps, Storage, RBAC, Governance)
- Automation with PowerShell, Bicep, and Terraform (soon)
- Building IaC-driven deployments and container-based solutions (AKS, ACR — coming)

---

### 🧠 Learning in Public

- I'm not pretending to be an expert—I’m showing my work as I build real skills.
- I share everything, from cert prep to project deployments.
- My goal: learn by doing, not just watching.

### 🔎 Now What?

Currently prepping for AZ-104 and working on automation-heavy cloud projects.
