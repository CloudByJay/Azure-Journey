## 📌 About Me

I'm Jason — the builder behind **CloudByJay**.

Before tech, I spent over 10 years in the transportation industry working frontline operations at Delta Airlines and the MTA. I’ve been a ramp agent, customer service rep, and currently work as a track worker with NYC Transit. My background is built on real-world pressure, teamwork, and zero-margin-for-error environments.

Now, I’m channeling that mindset into cloud computing. I’ve passed the **AZ-900**, and I’m currently working through **AZ-104**, learning Azure from the ground up and documenting everything here.

This repo tracks my progress — certs, notes, upcoming projects, and the journey from infrastructure rookie to skilled cloud professional.

> Not just changing careers — rebuilding from the ground up.
