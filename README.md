# 👋 Hi, I'm Jay (CloudByJay)

I'm a career transitioner with over 10 years of frontline experience in the transportation industry — from ramp agent and customer service at Delta Airlines to track worker at NYCTA.

Now, I’m building my future in **cloud computing** ☁️ — one cert, one project, and one repo at a time.
